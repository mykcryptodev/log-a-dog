# ðŸŒ­ Log a Dog

Welcome to the internet's hotdog eating contest! Log every dog you devour and climb the leaderboard while the crowd cheers you on.

## ðŸª™ Every Dog Is a Zora Coin
When you submit a hotdog photo, the app mints a Zora coin for that log. As the eater, you collect trading fees whenever your coin changes hands.

## ðŸ”’ Staking & Judging
Stake your $HOTDOG tokens to help judge whether logs are legit. Honest votes earn rewards while bad calls get slashed, so keep it fair!

## ðŸ“ˆ Earn and Trade
Buy and sell dog coins on the open market. Eaters pocket a piece of every trade, and bigger stakes mean bigger rewards.

## ðŸŽ‰ Join the Contest
Fire up your grill, log those dogs, and show the world your appetite. Itâ€™s all fun, memes, and tasty dogs.
